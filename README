#Flexbox navigation development

This is a Flexbox demo of a navigation system inspired by NET Magazine March 2017 edition. The demo adpots Flexbox as the primary layout methodolgy, I really wanted to see how it behaves over a plethora of devices with different vendors and versions. Constructed with Gulp to help with automation and optimisation.

##Note 

First time running Gulp, lots of code restructing to be done and applied to SASS files
